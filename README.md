# shOKU
## Terminal Based Roku Remote

This is just a simple bash script that uses curl to send keypresses to your roku.
To set up just edit the `IP=` to your roku IP. The default is `IP="192.168.1.2"`.
After that just run the script and start pressing buttons, A list of available buttons is show when you run.

```bash
Welcome to shOKU, Terminal Based Roku Remote
Use Arrow Keys to Move around
Enter for select
Home or h for Home
p to Pause and Play
b to go Back
f to Fast Forward
r to Rewind
1 = volume down
2 = volume up
7 = power
To Quit press q or e

```

If anyone has any ideas or ways to make this better, please have a go.
